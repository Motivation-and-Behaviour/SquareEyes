This projects seeks to better understand how children interact with the world around them. We've used wearable cameras to record the world from the child's perspective, and these documents describe how we interpret the data that has been captured.</p> <p>It is important that we are consistent in how we code the wearable camera data. Therefore, these documents are quite detailed and intended to minimise the number of decisions that need to be made. If you find anything unclear in these documents, let us know straight away so we can improve them.</p> <p>The goal is for these documents to act as both training and reference material for anyone joining the coding team.

Indicated by having a bright screen or visible content displayed on the screen of the device. Only active devices count as screen exposure.
