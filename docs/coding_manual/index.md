# Introduction

Welcome to the coding manual for the Square Project (also known as [KidVision](https://www.kidvision.edu.au/) to participants).
This projects seeks to better understand how children interact with the world around them.
We've used wearable cameras to record the world from the child's perspective, and these documents describe how we interpret the data that has been captured.

It is important that we are consistent in how we code the wearable camera data.
Therefore, these documents are quite detailed and intended to minimise the number of decisions that need to be made.
If you find anything unclear in these documents, let us know straight away so we can improve them.

The goal is for these documents to act as both training and reference material for anyone joining the coding team.
To use these documents for training, follow the navigation buttons at the bottom of each page to step through the material.
The search bar at the top can help you find specific topics.

## Improving these documents

You can help us improve these docs by submitting an [issue](https://github.com/Motivation-and-Behaviour/SquareEyes/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation&projects=&template=documentation.md&title=%5BDOCS%5D).

## Key Definitions

Throughout the manual, we use the following terms:

**Screen-based media device**
:   A technology platform with a screen that displays visual content for the purpose of education, entertainment, or communication (e.g., a television, smartphone or tablet).

**Active Screen-based media device**
:   A screen-based media device that has the appearance of being turned ‘on’ (i.e., has an active screen). Indicated by having a bright screen or visible content displayed on the screen of the device. Only active devices count as screen exposure.

**Inactive screen-based media device**
:   A screen-based media device that has the appearance of being turned ‘off’ (i.e., a black screen) or having a screen that is not visible (e.g., a phone face down on the table).

**Screen Exposure**
:   An event or episode where a person is in the presence of one or more active screen-based media devices, regardless of whether or not the person is consciously attending to the device.

**Screen Media**
:   Content on any technology platform with a screen.
