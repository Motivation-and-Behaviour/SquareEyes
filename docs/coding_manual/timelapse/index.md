# Timelapse Software

## Overview

[Timelapse](https://saul.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/timelapse/pmwiki.php?n=Main.HomePage) is the software we use to code images.
It's intended for labelling images of animals taken from camera traps, but we've adapted it to work with our wearable camera images.
The next sections describe how to install Timelapse, and how to apply the rules from the coding manual using the software.

## Installation

You can download the Timelapse software from the [Timelapse website](https://saul.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/timelapse/uploads/Installs/Timelapse2/Timelapse2-Executables.zips).

The instructions provided [on the Timelapse website](https://saul.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/timelapse/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Download2) explain how to extract and run the software.
To code images, you only need the `Timelapse2.exe` file - you won't need to use the template editor.
