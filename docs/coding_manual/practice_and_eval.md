# Coding Evaluation

Once you feel you have a good handle on the coding process, you can try coding some practice data.
This data has already been coded by the research team, so you can compare your results to theirs and discuss any points of difference.

The practice data is available on the network drive at `.../Square_Eyes_DP20_Data/Coding Evaluation`.
To complete the evaluation:

1. Make a copy of the `9999` folder in the same location.
2. Complete the setup process, including loading the template and importing the pre-coded data.
3. Code the images as per the coding rules.
4. Let the research team know when you're done to start the comparison process.
