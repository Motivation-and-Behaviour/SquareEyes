# Ethics Guidelines

The ethical guidelines below have been informed by a previously developed [ethical framework for wearable cameras in health behaviour research](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2012.11.006), ethical guidelines used in previous wearable camera research [^Signal^](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2017.02.016)^,^[^Willetts^](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-26174-1), and the [National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/national-statement-ethical-conduct-human-research-2023).

These are our guidelines:

## Guideline 1: Working with Children Checks

**All coders must have a valid Working With Children Check when coding images from participants who are children.**

???+ warning "Working With Children Checks"
    If you do not have a valid Working With Children Check, please talk with the research team so we can organise one.

## Guideline 2: Training and Declaration

**All coders must be aware of the ethical implications of coding image-based data and sign an ethical declaration statement.**

That is, you must complete this training and complete the declaration at the end.

## Guideline 3: Storage

**All collected images must be stored securely and password-protected on the ACU secure network drive.
Coders must not share their access passwords with anyone or give access to the ACU network drive to anyone outside of the coding team.**

We'll provide access to the network drive during your time as a coder.
When you finish coding, we'll revoke your access to the network drive.
Don't copy or move any of the files off the network drive.[^1]

[^1]: We make a limited exception for creating local caches under certain circumstances.
      See [Create a Local Cache](../../timelapse/setup/#create-a-local-cache) for more details.

## Guideline 4: Computer Security

**Coders must not leave their computer containing unsecured data unattended.
If coders leave their computer for any amount of time they must log out or lock their computer.**

If you are signed into a computer which has access to the network drive, you must log out or lock the computer when you leave it for any period of time.
On Windows, you can lock the computer by pressing ++win+l++.

Please do not lock the computer when you are finished for the day - make sure that you log out instead.

## Guideline 5: Participant Privacy

**Coders must protect the privacy and confidentiality of all participants.
Coders must not disclose any information of the content of any images with anyone outside of the research team.**

It can be surprising how something that seems innocuous can be used to identify someone.
For example, a detail about someone's house or about something that they were doing could incidentally reveal their identity.
For this reason, you must not describe the content of any of the images to anyone outside of the research team.

The other way that participant privacy could be compromised is if *you* recognise someone in an image.
If that's the case, you should stop coding and let the [project lead](../index.md#project-lead) know so that we can take appropriate action.

## Guideline 6: Duplication and Sharing

**Coders are not to make copies of any images, email images or post copies to the internet**

Under no circumstances should you make copies of any of the images.
This includes sending an image via email (including to the research team), taking a photo of an image, or posting an image to the internet.

If you do need to share an image with someone on the research team (e.g., to get a second opinion on a difficult to code image), you should just send them the file path to the image on the network drive.

## Guideline 7: Illegal Activities

**Coders must report images that depict illegal activities (including but not limited to abuse, violence or drug taking) to the principal investigator.**

It is unlikely, but possible, that you will see images that depict illegal activities.
If you see any activity in an image that you think might be illegal, you should let the [project lead](../index.md#project-lead) know so that we can take appropriate action.

## Guideline 8: Inappropriate Images

**Coders must report images that are of concern to the coder (e.g., inappropriate images) to the principal investigator.
In the case that a coder is negatively impacted by an image they see, coders are to inform the principal investigator who will assist the coder in gaining access to the appropriate services offered at the Australian Catholic University (e.g., counselling).**

It is possible that you will see images that you find inappropriate or distressing, even if they don't depict illegal activities.
For example, images of a child being bullied might be distressing to some coders.
In all cases, you can let the [project lead](../index.md#project-lead) know so that we remove you from coding that participant, and get you access to ACU services.

There are other cases where you will need to let the project team know about an image:

* Incidental nudity (e.g., a child forgot to disable the camera while getting changed).
  These images will need to be deleted.

## Guideline 9: Image Dissemination

**All images used in disseminated material must have any identifying features (e.g., faces, usernames, street names, business and school names) blurred or blocked out of the image.**

This guidelines is not relevant to coders.
It specifies the circumstances under which an image could be disseminated.
