# Codebook

This section defines the codes used in the coding software.
In most cases, the terms will be familiar to you, but it's important that we all use the same definitions.

## General Terms

`Unclassifiable` <a name="unclassifiable"></a>
:   An image is to be coded as `Unclassifiable` if the coder cannot identify some aspect of the code.
    Images should be coded to the lowest level possible.
    For example, if a coder is confident that the content is interactive, but they cannot tell what category of interactive media it is, they should code the content as as `Unclassifiable - Interactive`.
    However, if the coder can not tell if the content is interactive or passive, it should just be coded as `Unclassifiable`.

## Device

Devices are the technology platforms that display screen media.
The definitions for the codes used to identify devices are listed below.

`Mobile Device (Phone, iPod)`
:   A handheld device that can be used as a small computer, connect to the internet and run applications.
    Includes smartphones, feature phones and multi-purpose devices (e.g., Apple iPod Touch).

`Laptop Computer`
:   A computer that is battery operated and has an integrated screen.
    Indicated by an inbuilt keyboard.

`Tablet (iPad, eReader)`
:   A small, flat computer that is controlled by touching the screen with one’s finger or a special pen.
    Does not require a keyboard or mouse.
    Includes e-readers.

`Handheld Game Console`
:   Portable, self-contained devices that have a built-in screen, game controls and speakers.

`Television`
:   A device shaped like a box or rectangle with a screen that receives electrical signals and changes them into moving images.
    Can stand alone or be mounted to a wall.

`Desktop Computer`
:   A computer that fits on a desk but is not easily moved from place to place.
    Has a monitor, keyboard, mouse and tower.

`Digital Signage`
:   A screen-based media device that is in the form of a small to large billboard composed of LCD, LED or a similar display system.
    Includes digital sign boards, interactive direction signboards, electronic menus, billboards and similar display devices used for displaying visual information, promotional content and advertisements in public areas.

`Projector`
:   A device for showing films or images on a projection screen or other surfaces such as walls.
    Commonly used in movie theatres and schools.

`Not Elsewhere Classified`
:   Use this code when none of the previous codes cover the device in the image.
    Please also provide the device in the notes field.

`Unclassifiable`
:   See [Unclassifiable](#unclassifiable) in [General Terms](#general-terms).

## Content

The content facet of the framework has been included to code the screen media that participants are exposed to.
The content facet is made up of three sections: content type, content purpose, and violent content.

### Content Type

Content type refers to the type of screen media the participant is exposed to during screen exposure.
The content type facet is made up of two categories: passive screen media and interactive screen media.

`Unclassifiable`
:   See [Unclassifiable](#unclassifiable) in [General Terms](#general-terms).

#### Passive Screen Media

Screen media that requires no input or interaction during screen exposure, with the viewer only receiving screen-based information.
For example, watching a TV show or reading.

`Unclassifiable - Passive`
:   For use when the content is clearly passive, but cannot be confidently coded as one of the other options.
    See also [Unclassifiable](#unclassifiable) in [General Terms](#general-terms).

`Programme/TV/Video`
:   Any form of TV Show, movie or video.
    Includes online videos (e.g., videos being viewed on YouTube).

`Reading`
:   Any form of reading on a digital device.
    This should typically be longer-form text (eBook, news article, etc) so that it is distinct from [`General Internet`](#general-internet).

#### Interactive Screen Media

Screen media that requires real-time input from the child during the screen exposure.
For example, playing video games or browsing online.

`Unclassifiable - Interactive`
:   For use when the content is clearly interactive, but cannot be confidently coded as one of the other options.
    See also [Unclassifiable](#unclassifiable) in [General Terms](#general-terms).

`General Internet` <a name="general-internet"></a>
:   Includes all internet-based activities other than those for social media, gaming activity or watching online videos.
    Browsing is characterised searching and brief interactions with websites.
    Includes online shopping, using google and searching, but should be distinct from [`Social Media`](#social-media).

`Video Game`
:   Includes when a participant is playing a video game, or watching another person play a video game.

`Creation`
:   Creation screen media refers to visual content on screen-based media devices that has been created by the child.

`Communication`
:   Communication screen media refers to screen media that has the primary purpose of communicating with other people.
    Examples include messaging apps.

`Social Media` <a name="social-media"></a>
:   Websites, applications and computer programs that allow users to share information on the internet.
    Includes Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and blogs.

### Content Purpose

Content purpose refers to the intended purpose of the content.
That is, is the content intended to entertain or educate?

`Unclassifiable`
:   See [Unclassifiable](#unclassifiable) in [General Terms](#general-terms).

`Educational`
:   Screen media created with the purpose to educate, inform and enlighten the viewer.
    Educational screen media includes screen media that appears to be educational.
    Includes creation applications, educational video games, programmes and internet based activities where it appears that the screen media is educational (e.g., watching an educational TV show or completing homework online).

`Recreational`
:   Screen media created with the purpose to entertain the viewer, with no intentional purpose to education, inform or enlighten.
    Includes programmes, video games and internet based activities where it appears that the screen media is recreational (e.g., most TV shows, most video games or online shopping).

`Social`
:   Screen media created with the purpose to communicate with others.
    Social screen media includes screen media that appears to be social.
    Includes social media and communication applications.

`Other`
:   Use this code when you feel that you could identify the purpose (i.e., not `Unclassifiable`) but none of these codes sufficiently describes the purpose.

### Violent Content

`Violent Content`
:   Screen media that contains violence.
    Violence is defined as the use of physical force to harm someone, to damage property, etc.
    This code refers to the *entirety* of the content, rather than just what is visible in the image.
    That is, if a game has a violent component, the content should be coded as violent regardless of if the image displays the violence.
    A significant component of the content should be violent for it to be coded as violent content.

    <!-- TODO: Is this definition clear enough?? -->

## Context

The context dimension of the framework has been included to code the environment that the participant is when screen exposure occurs.
The content dimension is made up of four facets: location, social setting, social interactions and associated behaviours.

### Location

Location refers to the place or type of surroundings where the participant’s screen exposure occurs.
This section is made up of three categories: home, public, and transport.

`Unclassifiable`

### Social Setting

Social setting refers to who the participant is with during screen exposure.
This section is made up of five categories (alone, single adult, adults only, children only and mixed ages).
Indicators include another person being visible in the image.

`Unclassifiable`
:   See [Unclassifiable](#unclassifiable) in [General Terms](#general-terms).

`Alone`
:   No one else is visible in the image.

`Single Adult Only`
:   One person who appears to be over 18 years of age is visible in the image.

`Single Child Only`
:   ne person who appears to be under 18 years of age.

`Adults Only`
:   People who appear to be over 18 years of age are visible in the image only (must be multiple people)

`Children Only`
:   One or more people who appear to be under 18 years of age.

`Mixed Ages`
:   Multiple people in the image who are children and adults.

### Social Interactions

`Unclassifiable`
:   See [Unclassifiable](#unclassifiable) in [General Terms](#general-terms).

`Not interacting`
:   There is no one else in the image, or the other person/people in the image are not interacting with the participant.

`Co-participating`
:   When the child and another person are actively using a screen-based media device together.
    For example,a parent playing a video game with their child.

`Co-viewing`
:   When the child and another person are watching the same screen-based media device.
    Indicated by other people's body positioning facing the device.
    For example, a parent and child watching a TV show together.

### Associated Behaviours

Associated behaviours refers to co-occurring actions or tasks the child undertakes during screen exposure that is of interest to researchers.
Remember that these activities are only coded during a screen exposure episode.
That is, if there is no screen exposure you do not need to code these behaviours.

`No behaviour`
:   Used when there is no co-occuring behaviour of interest.


`Unclassifiable`
:   See [Unclassifiable](#unclassifiable) in [General Terms](#general-terms).

`Food or beverage`
:   The presence or observed consumption of food in an image.

`Homework`
:   Non-screen based homework activities.

`Other multitasking`
:   When a participant engages in another task or multiple tasks during screen exposure.
