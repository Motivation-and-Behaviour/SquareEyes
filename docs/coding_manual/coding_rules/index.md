# Introduction to Coding

The next section outlines the general process of coding images, and the protocol to follow during coding.

There are three main things you need to know before you start coding:

1. **Coding Rules**: These describe how to make a decision for a particular image.
2. **Coding Procedure**: This describes the actual process of coding images, such as the steps to take when coding.
3. **Code Book**: These are the definitions for the codes.

You'll likely need to reference these documents during coding.
