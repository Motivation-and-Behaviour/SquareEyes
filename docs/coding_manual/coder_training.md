# Coder Training

Coders must complete this coder training prior to coding any images.
After coder training, coders should have a strong understanding of the ethical guidelines for handling image-based data, an understanding of the codebook and knowledge of popular screen media and screen-based media devices used by the target population and an understanding of how to annotate an image.

Coder training includes four steps:

1. Ethics training
2. Coding process familiarisation
3. Timelapse software familiarisation
4. Image coding practice and evaluation
